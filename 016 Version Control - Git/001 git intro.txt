# Git, GitHub & Version Control - Quick Notes

## What is Version Control?
- A system that tracks changes in your code over time
- Helps you save different versions of your project
- Like a "save point" system in video games
- Allows you to go back to previous versions if something breaks
- Multiple people can work on the same project without conflicts

## What is Git?
- A free tool for version control
- Works on your computer (local)
- Tracks all changes you make to files
- Creates "snapshots" of your project called "commits"
- Helps you manage different versions of your code
- Most popular version control system in the world

## What is GitHub?
- A website that stores your Git projects online (cloud)
- Like Google Drive, but for code
- Lets you share your code with others
- Helps teams work together on the same project
- Shows your work to potential employers
- Free to use for public projects

## Key Differences
- **Git** = Tool on your computer (Software)
- **GitHub** = Website to store Git projects (Cloud Service)
- Think of it like: Git is Microsoft Word, GitHub is OneDrive

## Why Use Them?
- Save your work safely
- Collaborate with other developers
- Track who made what changes
- Undo mistakes easily
- Showcase your projects to the world
- Industry standard for developers
